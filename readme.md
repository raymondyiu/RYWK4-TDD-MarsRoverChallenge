# Mars Rover Challenge

## Project Overview

The Mars Rover Challenge is an exciting project that involves the exploration
of the red planet. Our main goal is to develop a robust 
software solution that can handle the complex challenges
of navigating and exploring the Martian landscape.

## Key Features

1. To create a rectangle plateau using the coordinates of the left (0,0) and right(x,y) corner points.
2. To place the Rover inside a plateau at a specific point(x,y)
and facing a certain direction eg. North
3. To instruct the Rover to move in a specific direction using actions such as turning left,
turning right, moving forward.
